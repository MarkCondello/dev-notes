## Namespacing
Namespacing can be set up for related code which is usually in the same directory. The namespaced name usually is the name of the directory.

When using namespacing, every class referenced in a namespaces class will assume to be loaded h=through its own namespace.

To include those classes, the `use CLASSNAME;` keywork is added.
