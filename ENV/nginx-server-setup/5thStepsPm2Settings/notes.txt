Git integration
From within the ~/.ssh directory, generate a new ssh key:
ssh-keygen

From within Git > Settings > SSH and GPG keys add the Public key content.

Update the ./ssh/config file:

Host github.com
Hostname github.com
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gh_private_key

Navigate back to the app directory and ensure the correct remote is set:
git remote -v

To test git connection through SSH run:
ssh -Tv git@github.com

Pull the latest code from the main branch:
git pull origin main
